# Setup

1. Run GenerateSolution.bat: This script runs genie.exe and will generate the solutions of the repository.
2. When the solution "FenixDK/FenixEngine.sln" is built it generates a static lib in the "FenixDK/build/" directory. 
This library is linked to by the samples solution "Samples/TestingFenix.sln"
